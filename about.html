  i am here to share you my experience when i reached my hometown
  it was 6th of june i travelled from dhule to nandurbar in the morning 
  it was around 8 am i entered in hometown and i was just smiling and realised
  that one year back when i used to come in hometown at that moment i used to be
  sad and today i just smiling.
</p>
<h4>how this much drastic change !</h4>
that before i used to be sad and today i am smiling this shows the attachment with your hometown.
whenever you leave your town for some reasons even though
you are still attached with your town even the new city gives you love care and another experience 
stilll we are in love with our town after a long when you reach your town it feels like we reached 
the peaceful place 
<h5>how beautiful its!</h5>
